      <p></p>The earliest Austronesian settlers of the Philippines established a variety of barangay communities under the leadership of local chiefs known as datus, beginning thousands of years ago.</p>
      The islands traded with China, Japan, India, and Islamic kingdoms in Southeast Asia prior to European contact.</p>
      After arriving in 1521 and colonizing the islands in 1565, Spain ruled for more than 300 years, bringing with them new political structures, Christianity, and Hispanic culture.</p>
      The late 19th century saw the growth of Filipino nationalism, which culminated in the 1896 Revolution and the country's declaration of independence in 1898. However, following the Spanish-American War, power quickly passed to the United States. Prior to Japan's occupation during World War II, the nation had developed democratic institutions, infrastructure, and public education under American rule.</p>
      The Philippines attained independence in 1946 following liberation in 1945.</p>
      Since then, the country has experienced periods of political hardship, such as the People Power Revolution of 1986 and the Marcos dictatorship, and it has continued to grow into a democratic nation with a diverse population.</p>
